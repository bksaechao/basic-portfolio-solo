# basic-portfolio-solo
### Task
<p> The goal of this project was to redo the previously completed project at a quicker pace with cleaner code.

### Results
<p> The previous project took about a days time with heavy use of an answer sheet from a completed project.
<p> Although the project isn't as creative as the previous one it only took about 3-4 hours of time with minimal use of guides or refrences. Overall SUCCESS!
